Reddit bot that delivers a random stat about an MMA fighter when called by a user on the [UFC](https://reddit.com/r/ufc) or [MMA](https://reddit.com/r/mma) subreddits.

Unfortunately, albeit hilariously, the [FighterFactBot account](https://reddit.com/u/FighterFactBot) was banned, as users were calling it so frequently that it became detrimental to actual discussion about MMA on the subreddit. Reddit users had called the bot over 3000 times before the moderators put it out to pasture.
