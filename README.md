This is a repository for my personal Github page / Web-page.

This page is a fork of the
[Beautiful-Jekyll]([https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll])).

I have fiddled a bit with the layouts and theming, but not much has
been changed from vanilla Jekyll. In particular, I have added support
for displaying up-to-date visualizations of trading data for select cryptocurrency tokens.
